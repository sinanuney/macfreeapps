        "description": "Demo available via TestFlight at fuguemachinerubato.com. Fugue Machine Classic users: see iOS App Store for discount bundle.Bend time. Automate notes. A single grid as a multi-dimensional musical canvas — for iPad, iPhone, and Mac.Fugue Machine Rubato dives deeper into the multi-playhead piano roll concept of Fugue Machine Classic by adding time-bending playheads, parameter automation, and much more.At the heart of the sequencer is a nonlinear time engine that lets playheads move with a natural — or surreal — feel. Unlike conventional sequencers, where time advances at a constant rate, time in this engine can expressively accelerate, decelerate, freeze, and change direction. Playheads are now free to swing, strum, bounce, move elastically, and more.Built upon the time engine is a robust parameter automation system with time-bending automation playheads and envelopes sculpted with points, curves, and shapes. Nearly everything can be automated — even the notes.Eight years in the making, Fugue Machine Rubato is rock-solid and absolutely packed with features.HIGHLIGHTS• Bend time with curves, rates, and offsets• Automate notes and nearly everything else• Sculpt envelopes with curves and shapes• Position playheads anywhere on the grid• Play up to eight playheads at once• Apply note echoes per-playhead• Arpeggiate notes from multiple playheads• Blend notes from multiple playheads• Offset, stack, spread, and invert pitches• Clamp, compress, and expand velocities• Program drums via per-note Drum Trigs• Route notes to up to eight MIDI outputs• Organize patterns in nestable folders• Launch patterns quantized to the beat• Revert state via auto-saved Snapshots• Learn contextually via popovers• Explore ~150 built-in patterns• Control via touch, keyboard, and cursor• Resize Mac window at native resolutionCOMPATIBILITYFugue Machine Rubato supports iPad, iPhone, Mac, Ableton Link, MIDI, and AUv3* MIDI.
